    After the job in school, I have started working as a GIS specialist at Geodetic Institute.

<h2>School</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    After graduation I started working as a teacher in elementary and high school where I had been working for five years. Even though it was great experience in improving communication and organizational skills, materializing the knowledge from college and smoothing the methods of explaining, I found myself more in programming and data analyzing.

<h1>Knowledge</h1>
<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

<h2>GIS</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    Official education is attained during geography study programmes at University of Zagreb.
In <a href="https://repozitorij.pmf.unizg.hr/islandora/object/pmf%3A3500/datastream/PDF/view" target="_blank">first master thesis</a> we described, analyzed and applied topographic prominence of peaks of Mt. Velebit in Croatia
with intention of findind correlation and/or causation with structural-geographic and morhometric settings of relief.
In <a href="https://dabar.srce.hr/islandora/object/pmf%3A4689" target="_blank">second master thesis</a> we applied morphometric analysis of relief and drainage basin on example of Mt. Petrova Gora.
In both master thesis ArcGIS was core element of writing them, especially with Spatial Analyst and Spatial Statistics toolboxes.

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    After completing geography study I started working as a teacher. Since I didn not have ArcGIS license, I started using QGIS as a main application for analysis, map making and automatizing processes with model builder. During teacher's years I held two QGIS workshops for my colleges in county during which we learnt how to make thematics and blank maps for class.
After the 2021 population census in Croatia, data was downloaded, organized and mapped. - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mikasm_i-zavr%C5%A1no-tri-osnovna-parametra-na-razini-activity-6981715874126671872-rbVt?utm_source=share%utm_medium=member_android" target="_blank">maps</a>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    At my current work as GIS specialist, we are working in ArcGIS and QGIS, depending on the customer choice. Job is mostly consisted of creating and maintaining spatial database, connecting it with SQL Oracle and internal programs for storing and analysing data and creating reports with Office programs. Since we are Geodetic institute, most of those data refer to geodetic surveys and their counties, but within our department I also worked on optimizing working of GIS files, on automatizing the work inside of them and existing queries and on fieldwork data collecting.

<h2>SQL</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    Before working in SQL, I have  completed two courses regarding SQL which gave me the foundation. Main environment at the Geodetic Institute was Oracle SQL Developer in which I was involved in all types of queries but <abbr title="Data Controling Language">DCL</abbr>.

<h1>Python</h1>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    Same as for SQL, I completed Python courses as an introduction to language. For improving python skills I have coded an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mikasm_i-zavr%C5%A1no-tri-osnovna-parametra-na-razini-activity-6981715874126671872-rbVt?utm_source=share%utm_medium=member_android" target="_blank">app</a> for geography which was used as a calculator for demographic parameters.
